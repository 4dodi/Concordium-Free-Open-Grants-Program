## Introduction 
The Concordium Free & Open Grants Program seeks to allocate resources to projects and open-source developers that are beneficial to the advancement of the Concordium ecosystem. 
 
The Concordium Free & Open Grants Program focuses on technology grants **up to $20,000 for initial grants** and **upto $75,000 for follow-up grants**, which are tracked transparently on GitHub and disbursed in GTU or Fiat. 
 
The Concordium Foundation aims to sponsor free open-source developers on an ad-hoc basis for their contribution to both Concordium and the RustLang ecosystem.
 
You can find a [list of areas](https://github.com/Concordium/Concordium-Open-Grants-Initiative/blob/main/alphacentauri_ideas.md) in the Concordium Technology Stack that demand particular development.

We also consider applications for any other project that furthers the general usability, adoption or functionality of the Concordium ecosystem or for the porting of projects onto the Concordium blockchain. 

And for the ones that are not feeling comfortable to go public, we accept private applications too [via this Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSePko0W26s-fIBpi60XHl7BVjcmvgLcXzHNIkUKeO5Wek2A8g/viewform). 


## Guidelines
Concordium welcomes everybody to apply for a grant. We aim to fund projects that like to dream big such that they add higher value to the opensource, decentralized world, but it is tobe dulynoted that we encourage project that are technical in nature that add value to both the Concordium and the Rust ecosystem.

Generally, it is to be noted by applicant projects that we encourage projects with the following :

The applying project is well-researched scientifically and technically or a tried and tested concept, with prior work history.
You show indications that the project will contiinue todeliver even after the grant is finalized, either by explicit commitment to applicability of technology on your side, additional financial resources or an existing business model that is sustainable.

Applicants have proven experience with the relevant languages and technologies and/or a strong technical background. Providing GitHub profiles of all team members as part of your application will be a huge plus and will examine these for past activity and code quality. Naturally, you can also link to projects on other platforms.
Your application is technically sound and clearly defined.
Your vision and understanding separates you uniquely among your competitors or you intend to build technology that is lacking in the ecosystem yet.
Additionally, it must fulfill the following requirements:

All code produced as part of a grant must be open-sourced, and it must also not rely on closed-source software for full functionality. We prefer Apache 2.0, but GPLv3, MIT or Unlicense are also acceptable.
A successful token sale, may not necessarily gurantee the successful grant award.
It is generally encouraged that you apply for a new grant once you have made your you have finished the prior grant you were garnted incase you did get a grant successfully.
Concordium is a Blockchain Project that expects 100% contamination free environment when it comes to legal scope of activities that are supported within the ecosystem, hence we do not fund projects that actively encourage gambling, illicit trade, money laundering or criminal activities in general.
Note that your project will need to comply with our [Guidelines for Milestone Deliverables](https://github.com/Concordium/Concordium-Free-Open-Grants-Program/blob/main/grants/milestone-deliverables-guidelines.md)

We expect all projects to create documentation that explains how their project works. At a minimum, written documentation is required for funding. Tutorials or videos are also helpful for new users to understand how to use your product. If your team's background is purely technical, consider working with a freelance or part-time technical writer as part of the grant.

We also have [Announcement Guidelines](https://github.com/Concordium/Concordium-Free-Open-Grants-Program/blob/main/grants/announcement-guidelines.md) for grant-related communication procedures.

Licensing and the right of all teams in and outside the ecosystem to be recognised for their work very seriously. Using others' work with no attribution or indication that this was not your own work as part of a milestone delivery will lead to immediate termination. Our team is friendly, reach out to us before submitting if you have any doubts on how to comply with a specific license and we'll be happy to help.
 
## The Concordium Free & Open Grants Program Committee 
 
The Committees consist of the Concordium Foundation representatives and the Concordium Foundation appointed individuals who will ensure that the funding priorities of the Concordium ecosystem are met. 
The committees evaluate quarterly grant applications and provide feedback on these applications.

Here is the Committees structure:  

### Executive Commitee 
* [Michael Jackson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mjmjmj/) - Former Skype COO and Mangrove Capital Partner 
* [Suhas Hegde](https://www.linkedin.com/in/suhashegde/) - Concordium Tech Community Programs Manager
* [Beni Issembert](https://www.linkedin.com/in/beniissembert/) - Concordium CMO  
* [Ernest Kissiediu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ernest-k-9a4975204/) - Concordium Developers Evangelist 
* [Dr. Torben Pedersen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/torben-pedersen-34b7563/) – Concordium CTO

### Steering Commitee
* Lone Fonss-Schroder – Concordium CEO
* Jørgen Hauglund – Concordium CFO
* Prof. Ueli Mahrer - ETH Zurick
* Prof. Hans Gersbach – ETH Zurich
* Dr. Ales Bizjak – Concordium Senior Software Engineer 
* Dr. Thomas Dinsdale-Young – Concordium Senior Researcher 

## Project ideas
An non-exhaustive overview of ideas and broad project ideas we would potentially be interested in funding can be found [here](https://github.com/Concordium/Concordium-Open-Grants-Initiative/blob/main/alphacentauri_ideas.md). 
Soon a complete list of accepted applications will be available too. 

Applications represent concrete and deployable ideas for projects that we aim to see running on top of Concordium. Teams are encouraged to apply even if another team has already applied to implement a certain project, we invite you to proceed anyway if you are interested.

Last but not least, you don’t need to start your project from scratch to be able to apply for a grant. Some teams working on other chains are willing to port their existing projects to Concordium, where the relevant licenses allow of course. Some of these teams are interested in contributing to an existing open-source reject. In this case, you should check in advance that the maintainers of the project are willing to onboard you. 
## Public Application
We recommend checking out the technical grant [template](https://github.com/Concordium/Concordium-Open-Grants-Initiative/blob/main/Free%20%26%20Open%20Grant%20Proposal%20Template.md). It gives an indication of what a good roadmap should look like, plus it outlines the criteria of what we look for in an application.
 
Fully or partially public applications should be made via a pull request to this repo by following the steps below: 
* Fork this repository.
* In the newly created fork, create a copy of the technical grant template.
* Most applications should go into the speculative sub-folder.
* In the few cases where the application is a response to a specific RFP then the application should go into the rfps sub-folder.
* Label the file as "project_name.md".
* Fill out the template with the details of your project.
* Once you have completed the application, click on "create new pull request".
* The body of the pull request will show a template that requests an abstract of the project and the completion of a checklist. 

Please complete as appropriate and take care to include all necessary information. 

## Private Application
Privacy is all for Concordium and we understand that some of you would prefer to keep their work private. 
For this purpose, we have a parallel process in place. 
All what you have to do is to fill this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/149AsWh5aDa7EkepK5dEp-2P65c5NqXjJb1UlJoEI9_I/edit) and we will get back to you asap. 

 

## Review
The Committee will review the applications received, determine if more information is required, and potentially schedule a call with the team.
Third party experts may also assist in the review of applications.
 
## Decision
The Committee will notify the applicants of whether their proposal has been accepted or not.
If an application is accepted, further communication will be required to determine some specific details around timelines and payment schedules.
 
## Follow-up
Once progress has started, the Committee and the relevant teams will have follow-up conversations to see how the project is progressing.
A weekly meeting at least will be mandatory for each granted team. 
 
 
## Payment
The Committee makes the payment to the GTU address specified in the initial application or to a FIAT-based bank account, subject to normal full KYC and proper due diligence.
Grant applications can be amended at any time, necessitating a reevaluation by the Committee.
Up to 4 weeks after the acceptance of an application, funds will be wired. 
A fully compliant “receipt” will be asked in return. 
 
## Licensing 
In order to successfully receive grant funding for your application, it is necessary for the project to have open-source code. We prefer Apache 2.0 but the GNU GPL v3 license is also acceptable.
 
## Documentation
To ensure ease-of-use we require all projects to create comprehensive documentation that explains how their project works. 
At a minimum, written documentation is required for funding.
Tutorials or videos are also helpful for new users to understand how to use the product.
