# Announcement Guideline Protocols & Procedures

> Protocols & Procedures updated July 2021

Concordium Foundation supports all teams and organizations throughout the ecosystem who are proactively building the future of the decentralized web. It can benoted that we receive requests to participate in project announcements. Unfortunately, due to the high volume of requests and other sensitive considerations, we rarely do joint announcements and do not provide quotes.

In the context of the grants programs, we recommend teams not to make any announcements before **the first milestone has been accepted**. It is in Concordium Foundation's interest to protect the community from projects that only intend to use the grant announcement to raise funds and/or interest but don't intend to deliver on the application, which has unfortunately observed in the past for several projects evenoutside the Concordium Ecosystem. For this reason, we reserve the right to terminate grants if this rule is not observed.

On completion of your milestone, Concordium can help by reviewing and proofreading your blogpost. When you have drafted your announcement, send it to your contact at Concordium Grants Committie and add grants@concordium.com in cc. Please allow upto 7 working days where possible for proofreading articles and wait until the milestone has been accepted to publish it.

We can also cross-promote the most recent projects and their milestones on Twitter and in the monthly newsletter every month, so please keep us updated and send us the links to your published tweets regarding your announcements.

## Standard protocol to follow when writing your post :

- The post should be meaningful and strategic in nature, focusing on the tech rather than the "announcement" element.
- The team should point to the work, in order to attract attention for the project and demonstrate momentum in the ecosystem. It should be informative for builders and the larger community.
- The post should include a link to a GitHub repository or appropriate links to showcase what's been built so far.
- Suggested content items for the post:
  - What the team has built so far.
  - Team's future development plans.
  - How the technology will contribute to the Concordium Ecosystem and the larger ethos of the Decentralized Web.

## Key components

1. A blog post header image
   - An image helps when sharing the announcement on social networks. It's more prominent in feeds and looks more professional.

## We like to keep it simple,clean and honest
  
1. It is recommended to ese specific verbs such as colloborate, integrate, support or build.
2. Avoid hype descriptors like partner/partnership, collaborations, affiliate, strategic or long-term in these announcementsâ€”due to the sensitive natureof those announcements that may influence Ill-Investors in making any decisions that are not thoroughly researched. 
3. Don't indicate that Concordium prefers a certain technology over all others:
   - As such, do not use: "Concordium recommends that teams use this tech to build XYZ"
   - Focus on the merits of the tech: "This technology provides great utility for the Concordium Network andvice versa"

We look forward to working with you in creating the next generation blockchain ecosystem! If you have any questions or would like to be included in our next announcement, please email grants@concordium.com
