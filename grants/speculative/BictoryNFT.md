## Project name
The name of the project is: Bictory NFT

## Project overview
 
### General
Bictory Finance is building a curated and exclusive NFT platform for minting NFTs on Concordium. Among minting capabilities, BictoryNFT will release a premium NFT collection called “Terrestria”, NFT holders will enjoy perks, discounts, and exclusive access to Bictory’s suite of products. 

By bringing to life our NFT platform, Bictory will promote Concordium technology and its Smart Contracts capability as a working proof because of the applications built on top of it. Furthermore, Concordium will showcase its scalability and regulatory-ready solutions. It will allow users worldwide to interact with Concordium as a technology and the native CCD token. Every user of the NFT platform will need to register on either the Concordium mobile app or the desktop wallet to create an ID and Pass the KYC requirement.

NFT Smart Contract will comply with the Concordium Network's CIS1 standard. 

Our integration with the Concordium blockchain will work by maintaining concordium-nodes (HA). Bictory application’s backend servers will communicate with concordium-nodes through the API. The API will wrap a gRPC interface exposed by the concordium-node. 

Our team has vast experience in blockchain projects, security, and scalability, and we are excited about the Concordium blockchain and its smart-contracts capability. We see this as an opportunity to build a needed product on new top-notch emerging technology.

### Description 
Following the “reverse-engineering” approach, we can describe our final NFT platform as a secure, scalable, reliable, and fast service for NFT minting, buying, and selling. Each feature passed our internal security review, and we are continuously checking our project dependency for CVE. Our developers are familiar with OWASP(Open Web Application Security Project). Our auto-scalable architecture allows us to keep going with a high load and release resources when needed. For new region expansion, we have a well-defined terraform file set (IaC). Each part of the backend system issues logs, and we are checking on system health with Grafana. Our UI/UX is the result of long-term A/B testing.


Here are our steps to reach this goal in our reverse engineering process:
* Writing IaC to provision infrastructure in new regions.
* 24h DevOps support in 3 shifts
* Penetration testing
* Checking system performance for bottlenecks and rewriting some code in Rust
* Many different benchmarks
* Configuration of Grafana for easy data analysis
* Our cloud-based infrastructure is fully provisioned from code (IaC)
* Setting up A/B testing
* Code refactored
* Adding features and testing
* Product owners update features and set new priorities.
* Smart-contract deployed and instantiated to the Concordium MainNet
* Production env deployed, tested & fixed.
* POC ready
* Production env provisioned and CI/CD pipeline updated.
* Added swagger comments for endpoints, code coverage >90% by automatic tests
* Software architecture keeps supervision of POC, and we are working on a detailed design for dedicated parts of the system.
* We have well defined CI/CD pipeline process on GitLab with a full range of code checks, from style to static code analysis.
* Smart-contract deployed and instantiated to Concordium testnet
* Frontend and backend teams agree on the API, Frontend working on UI and getting data from the API stub. Backend provisions staging env in the cloud writes dockerfiles, and docker creates a file to set up local development env.
* We defined the initial CI/CD pipeline process on GitLab, a defined code review process, and an agile approach to project management.
* Software architecture has begun analysis and prepared a high-level design for POC.
* We have created mockups, discussed ideas, and our product owner populated our backlog with user stories.
* We have a strong plan and a good idea of the direction we are taking for BictoryNFT.

Current problems/issues you are encountering:
* Finalization of NFT’s Meta-data schema
* CryptoX wallet integration
* Spaceseven integration 

How could Concordium help you?:
* Concordium could help us understand the best way to add various functionalities in smart contracts.

### Benchmark

Please name the projects you are competing with: 

Competition is an important component of innovation, and at Bictory, we believe in the insights and “aha moments” that are only possible through healthy competition as well as collaboration. BictoryNFT is the first premium NFT collection on Concordium at the moment. As such, we would only consider NFT collections as competitors, not necessarily marketplaces. A good example would be an NFT collection on marketplaces such as Opensea and Spaceseven. Opensea and Spaceseven, however, are the marketplace and are ruled out of our books as far as competitions go.
